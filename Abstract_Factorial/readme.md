Abstract factory pattern can be used when:

- You want to hide the creation and representation of a set of products
- When you have many classes with a common interface
- When the usage of the objects you wanna provide is indipendent from the creation process

This pattern works pretty well combined with a singleton pattern too (factories are singleton).
