# Design Patterns
This repository contains all well known coding design patterns: for each pattern there is a pretty simple use case with a brief description.

- [Creational](https://github.com/Kegbird/design_patterns/tree/main/Creational)
- [Structural](https://github.com/Kegbird/design_patterns/tree/main/Structural)

The repository is currently work in progress and most of these implementations are written based on the gang of four book.
