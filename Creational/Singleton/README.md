# Singleton pattern

Singleton pattern can be used when:

- You need a single instance of a class which is shared by all clients.
- When the only instance of a class should be extensible and clients should be able to use extended instances without change the code.

In this example there is a simple logger class, which allows to log message by using the reference to the same instance.
